# About login-php-native
A simple login form with PHP native

# How to Create
1. Create the Form file or login.php
2. Then you can connect it to handler.php as the intermediary between the form file and database
3. This requires manual validation so I added Validation.php for a reference
4. Create root.php to connect it to database
5. Finish
